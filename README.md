# Child-Respiratory-Disease
A dataset concerning the relationship between respiratory function (measured by forced expiratory volume, FEV) and smoking. FEV (forced expiratory volume) is an index of pulmonary function that measures the volume of air expelled after one second of constant effort. The data contains determinations of FEV on 654 children ages 6-22 who were seen in the Childhood Respiratory Desease Study. The data are part of a larger study to follow the change in pulmonary function over time in children.
